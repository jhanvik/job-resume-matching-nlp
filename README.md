# Job–Resume Matching System (TF-IDF + SBERT)

This project builds an end-to-end NLP pipeline to match resumes with relevant job postings.

## Features
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Category-aware job filtering
- TF-IDF based similarity matching
- SBERT semantic embeddings
- Hybrid scoring (lexical + semantic)
- Skill extraction and skill-gap analysis

## Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- sentence-transformers (SBERT)
- pandas, numpy

## Output
- Top-K job matches per resume
- Explainable skill-gap insights

## Next Steps
- Dockerization
- Streamlit UI
- Hybrid ranking optimization
